# Serverless Manifest example

This is a demonstration of the [serverless-manifest-plugin](https://github.com/DavidWells/serverless-manifest-plugin) and how you can use it to automatically sync backend values to your frontend.

A.k.a. no more manually syncing API gateway URLs into your `.env` files.

The manifest plugin can do a LOT more, but this is one use case I find particularly helpful.
